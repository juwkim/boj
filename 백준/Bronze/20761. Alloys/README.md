### 문제 설명

<p>Pelle is building a new advanced underground drill. He wants to build the drill out of a new titanium-aluminium-magnesium alloy. Such an alloy can be mixed in many ways. If an alloy is made with the ratios $x, y, z$ ($x + y + z = 1$) of titanium, aluminium and magnesium, the alloy gets a hardness of $xy$, and a price of $x + y$ SEK per kilogram.</p>

<p>Pelle only has a fixed amount of money per kilogram that he can spend on alloys for his drills. What is the maximum hardness he can get on his new alloy?</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first and only line of input contains a decimal number $c$ ($0 \le c < 2$, between $1$ and $6$ digits after the decimal point) -- the amount of money in SEK that Pelle can spend per kilogram alloy.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Output a single decimal number, the maximum hardness of Pelle's alloy.</p>

<p>Your answer will be considered correct if you have an absolute error of at most ${10}^{-6}$.</p>
