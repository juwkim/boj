### 문제 설명

<p>Two fractions are considered “neighbors” if the numerator of the reduced positive difference between the two fractions is 1. For example, the fractions 1/11 and 1/12 subtract to be 1/132, and are therefore “neighbors”. However, 2/5 and 4/5 differ by 2/5, and are not neighbors. Determine and output either the “neighbor” fraction value, or output “NOT NEIGHBORS”.</p>

### 입력
