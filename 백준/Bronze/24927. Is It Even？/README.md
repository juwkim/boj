### 문제 설명

<p>You are a leading programmer at Company<sup>TM</sup>, and have been given the following task. Given a list of $N$ integers $x_1, \dots ,x_N$, is their product $x_1⋅x_2⋅ \dots ⋅x_N$ even? You plug away at the problem using every trick in the book, and come up with a very elegant solution. Lo and behold, your supervisor <i>then</i> informs you that the task has changed! It turns out the higher ups want you to find out if the product $x_1⋅x_2⋅ \dots ⋅x_N$ is divisible by $2^K$ for some integer $K≥0$.</p>

<p>You just can’t catch a break!</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The input consists of two integers $N,K$ ($1≤N≤100000$ and $0≤K≤1000$). These are followed by $N$ lines, each with a single value $x_1, \dots ,x_N$ respectively ($1≤x_i≤10^9$ for each $1≤i≤N$) which form the product.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Display <code>1</code> if $2^K$ divides $x_1⋅x_2⋅ \dots ⋅x_N$, otherwise display <code>0</code>.</p>
