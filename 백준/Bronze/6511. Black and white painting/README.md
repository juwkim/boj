### 문제 설명

<p>You are visiting the Centre Pompidou which contains a lot of modern paintings. In particular you notice one painting which consists solely of black and white squares, arranged in rows and columns like in a chess board (no two adjacent squares have the same colour). By the way, the artist did not use the tool of problem A to create the painting.</p>

<p>Since you are bored, you wonder how many <em>8 × 8</em> chess boards are embedded within this painting. The bottom right corner of a chess board must always be white.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The input contains several test cases. Each test case consists of one line with three integers n, m and c. (<em>8 ≤ n, m ≤ 40000</em>), where n is the number of rows of the painting, and m is the number of columns of the painting. c is always <em>0</em> or <em>1</em>, where <em>0</em> indicates that the bottom right corner of the painting is black, and <em>1</em> indicates that this corner is white.</p>

<p>The last test case is followed by a line containing three zeros.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each test case, print the number of chess boards embedded within the given painting.</p>
