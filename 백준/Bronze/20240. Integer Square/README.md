### 문제 설명

<p>Iris likes to draw different shapes on a grid paper. Her favorite shape is a square. She has recently tried to draw a square with area $s$, but since she uses a grid paper, she wants all the vertices of the square to have integer coordinates.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="" style="width: 393px; height: 384px;"></p>

<p>Can you help her find such a square?</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The input contains a single integer $s$ ($1\le s\le 1000$).</p>

### 출력 

 <p>If it is possible to construct the required square, output four pairs of integers: the coordinates of the vertices of the square, in any order. All coordinates should be in the range from $-10^9$ to $10^9$. If there are multiple answers, output any of them.</p>

<p>If it is impossible to construct the required square, print "<code>Impossible</code>".</p>
