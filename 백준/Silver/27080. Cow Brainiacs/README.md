### 문제 설명

<p>One afternoon as the cows were chewing their cud, Bessie said, "Let's have a contest to see who is the smartest cow.  Here's the contest:  we will choose a positive number N (no larger than 2,000,000) and whoever computes the rightmost non-zero digit of N factorial will be crowned the smartest cow."</p>

<p>The other cows demurred, however, mooing, "We did that last year."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Bessie, "but there's a catch.  We're not necessarily going to use base 10.  I know my hooves don't have that many digits!  We'll just specify a positive number base B from 2 through 29."</p>

<p>Write a program to help the cows judge their intelligence contest.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>A single line with integers N and B</p>

### 출력 

 <p>A single line with the decimal-representation of the "digit" that is the rightmost non-zero digit for N! in base B.  If B > 10, go ahead and output a two-digit decimal number as a representation of the final "digit".</p>
