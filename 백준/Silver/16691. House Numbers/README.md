### 문제 설명

<p>Peter was walking down the street, and noticed that the street had houses numbered sequentially from m to n. While standing at a particular house x, he also noticed that the sum of the house numbers behind him (numbered from m to x − 1) equaled the sum of the house numbers in front of him (numbered from x + 1 to n).</p>

<p>Given m, and assuming there are at least three houses total, find the lowest n such that this is possible.</p>
