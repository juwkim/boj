### 문제 설명

<p>Mr. Panda has managed to infiltrate into the NUS servers and plans to get information about the N questions in the upcoming NOI. Unfortunately, Mr. Panda’s skills are not good enough to get the questions themselves. However, he is able to get information about the difficulty of each question. He is also able to change the order the questions will come out for the actual NOI. Currently, the questions are not sorted in order of difficulty. To make his life easier, he would like to sort the questions in increasing order of difficulty from easiest to hardest.</p>
