### 문제 설명

<p>A palindrome is a string of symbols that is equal to itself when reversed. Given an input string, not necessarily a palindrome, compute the number of swaps necessary to transform the string into a palindrome. By swap we mean reversing the order of two adjacent symbols. For example, the string "mamad" may be transformed into the palindrome "madam" with 3 swaps:</p>

<ul>
	<li>swap "ad" to yield "mamda"</li>
	<li>swap "md" to yield "madma"</li>
	<li>swap "ma" to yield "madam"</li>
</ul>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of input gives n, the number of test cases. For each test case, one line of input follows, containing a string of up to 100 lowercase letters.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Output consists of one line per test case. This line will contain the number of swaps, or "Impossible" if it is not possible to transform the input to a palindrome.</p>
