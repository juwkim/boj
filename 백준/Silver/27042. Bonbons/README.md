### 문제 설명

<p>FJ knows that the cows (like everyone else) love bonbons, which are very expensive candy. He has decided to purchase and give a single bonbon to one of his N (1 ≤ N ≤ 7,100,000) cows (which are conveniently numbered 1..N).  He lines the cows up in order in a circle and starts with cow 1.  He moves to cow 2 and asks her to leave the circle.  He moves to cow 4 and asks her to leave. He continues to ask every other cow to leave the circle until only one remains -- and she gets the bonbon.</p>

<p>Determine which cow gets the bonbon.</p>
