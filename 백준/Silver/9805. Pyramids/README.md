### 문제 설명

<p>Recently in Farland, a country in Asia, a famous scientist Mr. Log Archeo has discovered ancient pyramids. But unlike those in Egypt and Central America, they have triangular (not rectangular) foundation. That is, they are tetrahedrons in mathematical sense. In order to find out some important facts about the early society of the country (it is widely believed that the pyramid sizes are in tight connection with Farland ancient calendar), Mr. Archeo needs to know the volume of the pyramids. Unluckily, he has reliable data about their edge lengths only. Please, help him!</p>

### 입력

### 출력 

 <p>A real number -- the volume printed accurate to four digits after decimal point.</p>
