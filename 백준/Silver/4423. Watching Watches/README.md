### 문제 설명

<p>It has been said that a watch that is stopped keeps better time than one that loses 1 second per day. The one that is stopped reads the correct time twice a day while the one that loses 1 second per day is correct only once every 43,200 days. This maxim applies to old fashioned 12-hour analog watches, whose hands move continuously (most digital watches would display nothing at all if stopped).</p>

<p>Given two such analog watches, both synchronized to midnight, that keep time at a constant rate but run slow by k and m seconds per day respectively, what time will the watches show when next they have exactly the same time?</p>

<p> </p>

### 입력 

 <p>Input consists of a number of lines, each with two distinct non-negative integers k and m between 0 and 256, indicating the number of seconds per day that each watch loses.</p>

<p> </p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each line of input, print k, m, and the time displayed on each watch, rounded to the nearest minute. Valid times range from 01:00 to 12:59</p>

<p> </p>
